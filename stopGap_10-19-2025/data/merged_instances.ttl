Two metrics derived from the LSA model of communication content are (a) the vector length of a piece of discourse and (b) the cosine between two pieces of discourse. We use these metrics to analyze (a) the semantic content contained in an utterance and (b) the semantic similarity between different pieces of discourse. The vector length of an utterance measures the amount of speech weighted by the domain-specific content the discourse contains. It is calculated as the Euclidean norm of a vector of words (e.g., an utterance) plotted in the semantic space. The cosine between any two pieces of discourse (e.g., any two utterances, any two training segments, any two transcripts) is the vector dot product between two word vectors containing the discourse plotted in the semantic space. Cosine measures the degree of semantic similarity, or correlation, between any two pieces of discourse.

communication content analysis provides a gauge on the interactive expression of domain-relevant knowledge as team members interact (Cooke & Gorman, 2009). We analyzed communication content using LSA (Landauer, Foltz, & Laham, 1998). LSA is a mathematical/statistical method for representing and analyzing semantic knowledge in a particular work domain and is based on the theory that knowledge is reflected in how words group into contexts within meaningful discourse""" ;
